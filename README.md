**FOR "I AM THE SMARTEST IDIOT" CLASSMATE(S): this IS NOT a free ride for your homework. When you get caught using my gigabrain, I'll proudly wave this repository, timestamps, hidden indicators, as proof of my originality while you get a front-row seat to your ethics hearing. Consider yourself warned 💅**
